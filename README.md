Full Disclaimer; A lot of this code was hastily written in the limited time around my full time job. I've ironed out a lot of bugs from it but the resulting code is not elegant or nice to look at, it's not to the quality I'd usually aim for but hey, that's what Game Jams are for!

## Gameplay
Up Beat is a Foddian-Inspired Rhythm Game, where the beats pressed prompt a small blobby boy to ascend the note chart, be careful though as one wrong move could spell disaster as your round friend tumbles down the notes, undoing your progress through the song!
